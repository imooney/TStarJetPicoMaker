## TStarJetPicoMaker

**STAR Collaboration**

**Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, BNL**

This project is Nick Elsey's, but I modify it slightly to take in STAR miniMCs as well, with no need for Geant files.
Please address all praise to Nick, and all criticism to Isaac Mooney.


Produces TStarJetPico root files from STAR muDSTs,
Will provide implementation for PicoDSTs as they come
online at BNL. The old StMuJetAnalysisTreeMaker is provided 
for backwards compatibility, testing & comparison, but shouldn't
be used going forward as there are bugs that are fixed in the new
Maker.


These libraries require the root4star framework. Additionally, we use
[StRefMultCorr](https://github.com/GuannanXie/Run14AuAu200GeV_StRefMultCorr.git)
and [eventStructuredAu](https://github.com/kkauder/eventStructuredAu.git).
Versions that are compatible with the Maker are embedded in StRoot 
already. If you want to update, they are kept as submodules 
in external/. You can initialize the submodules via 
```git submodule update --init --recursive```

## Usage

After cloning the repository, you can use 

```
./macros/configure.sh
```

to create some needed directories. Compile the libraries via  

```
./macros/compile.csh
```

You can play around with some of the scripts in sandbox/, where everything is in a
single directory. You must fill a file named test.list with valid muDST 
file paths first to use the scripts provided.
